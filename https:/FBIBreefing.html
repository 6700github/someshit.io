 <h1 class="field-content page-title"></h1>STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A WRAY DIRECTOR FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY UNITED STATES SENATE AT A HEARING ENTITLED OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION THE JANUARY 6TH INSURRECTION DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND OTHER THREATS PRESENTED MARCH 2 2021 STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A WRAY DIRECTOR FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY UNITED STATES SENATE AT A HEARING ENTITLED FBI OVERSIGHT PRESENTED MARCH 2 2021 Good morning Chairman Durbin Ranking Member Grassley and Members of the Committee I am honored to be here representing the men and women of the FBI Our people  nearly 37 000 of them  are the heart of the Bureau I am proud of their service and their commitment to our mission Every day they tackle their jobs with perseverance professionalism and integrity  sometimes at the greatest of costs Just last month two of our agents made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty Special Agents Dan Alfin and Laura Schwartzenberger left home to carry out the mission they signed up for  to keep the American people safe They were executing a federal court-ordered search warrant in a violent crimes against children investigation in Sunrise Florida when they were shot and killed Three other agents were also wounded that day Well be forever grateful for their commitment and their dedication  for their last full measure of devotion to the people they served and defended We will always honor their sacrifice Despite the many challenges our FBI workforce has faced I am immensely proud of their dedication to protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution Our country has faced unimaginable challenges this past year Yet through it all whether it was coming to the aid of our partners during the Capitol siege and committing all of our resources to ensuring that those involved in that brutal assault on our Democracy are brought to justice the proliferation of terroristic hate moving at the speed of social media abhorrent hate crimes COVID-19 related fraud and misinformation the increasing threat of cyber intrusions and state sponsored economic espionage malign foreign influence and interference the scourge of opioid trafficking and abuse or human trafficking and crimes against children the women and men of the FBI have unwaveringly stood at the ready and taken it upon themselves to tackle any and all challenges thrown their way - 2 - The list of diverse threats we face underscores the complexity and breadth of the FBIs mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States I am pleased to have received your invitation to appear today and am looking forward to engaging in a thorough robust and frank discussion regarding some of the most critical matters facing our organization and the Nation as a whole Capitol Violence First and foremost I want to assure you your staff and the American people that the FBI has deployed every single tool at our disposal and our full arsenal of investigative resources to aggressively pursue those involved in the heinous violence and criminal activity that occurred on January 6 2021 We are working closely with our federal state and local law enforcement partners as well as private sector partners to identify those responsible for the violence and destruction of property at the U S Capitol building who showed blatant and appalling disregard for our institutions of government and the orderly administration of the democratic process Our agents analysts and professional staff have been working non-stop with federal prosecutors to gather and preserve evidence share intelligence and identify and bring charges against those who participated in the siege of the U S Capitol As we have said consistently we do not and will not tolerate violent extremists who use the guise of First Amendment protected activity to wreak havoc and incite violence Thus far our investigators have identified hundreds of individuals involved in the siege of the Capitol Complex and already charged well over 300 of them Many of those identifications are the result of the over 200 000 digital media tips we have received from the public Members of the public who have any information related to the siege should continue to provide tips information and videos of illegal activity at www tips fbi gov or by calling 1-800-CALL-FBI Overall the FBI assesses that the January 6th siege of the Capitol Complex demonstrates a willingness by some to use violence against the government in furtherance of their political and social goals This ideologically motivated violence underscores the symbolic nature of the National Capital Region and the willingness of Domestic Violent Extremists to travel to events in this area and violently engage law enforcement and their perceived adversaries The American people should rest assured that we will continue to work to hold accountable those individuals who participated in the violent breach of the Capitol on January 6 th and any others who attempt to use violence and destruction to intimidate coerce or influence the American people or affect the conduct of our government Top Terrorism Threats As has been stated multiple times in the past preventing terrorist attacks in all forms remains the FBIs top priority The nature of the threat posed by terrorism  both international terrorism IT and domestic terrorism DT  continues to evolve - 3 - The most significant threat to our homeland is posed by lone actors who often radicalize online and seek out soft targets to attack with easily accessible weapons We see these individualized threats manifested within both Domestic Violent Extremists DVEs and Homegrown Violent Extremists HVEs Although they have different ideologies they both typically radicalize and mobilize to violence on their own and are both located primarily in the United States Individuals who commit violent criminal acts in furtherance of ideological goals stemming from domestic influences  some of which include racial or ethnic bias or strong anti-government or anti-authority sentiments  are described as DVEs whereas HVEs are individuals inspired primarily by achieving global jihad but not receiving individualized direction from Foreign Terrorist Organizations FTOs Domestic and Homegrown Violent Extremists are often motivated and inspired by a mix of socio-political ideological and personal grievances against their targets and more recently have focused on accessible targets to include civilians law enforcement and the military symbols or members of the U S Government houses of worship retail locations and mass public gatherings Selecting these types of soft targets in addition to the insular nature of their radicalization and mobilization to violence and limited discussions with others challenges law enforcement to detect and disrupt the activities of lone actors before they occur The top threat we face from DVEs continues to be those we identify as Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists RMVEs specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race and who were the primary source of ideologically-motivated lethal incidents of violence in 2018 and 2019 It is important to note that we have recently seen an increase in lethal DVE attacks perpetrated by Anti-Government or Anti-Authority Violent Extremists specifically Militia Violent Extremists and Anarchist Violent Extremists Anti Government or Anti-Authority Violent Extremists were responsible for three of the four lethal DVE attacks in 2020 Also in 2020 we saw the first lethal attack committed by an Anarchist Violent Extremist in over 20 years Consistent with our mission the FBI does not investigate First Amendment-protected speech or association peaceful protests or political activity The FBI holds sacred the rights of individuals to peacefully exercise their First Amendment freedoms Non-violent protests are signs of a healthy democracy not an ailing one Regardless of their specific ideology the FBI will aggressively pursue those who seek to hijack legitimate First Amendment - protected activity by engaging in violent criminal activity such as the breach destruction of property and violent assaults on law enforcement officers that we witnessed on January 6th and during lawful protests throughout the U S during the summer of 2020 In other words we will actively pursue the opening of FBI investigations when an individual uses  or threatens the use of  force violence or coercion in violation of federal law and in the furtherance of a political or social ideological goal The FBI assesses HVEs as the greatest most immediate international threat to the Homeland As I have described HVEs are United States-based individuals located in and radicalized primarily in the U S who are not receiving individualized direction from global - 4 - jihad-inspired FTOs but are inspired largely by the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham ISIS and al-Qaida to commit violence An HVEs lack of a direct connection with an FTO ability to rapidly mobilize without detection and use of encrypted communications pose significant challenges to our ability to proactively identify and disrupt them The FBI remains concerned that Foreign Terrorist Organizations such as ISIS and al Qaida intend to carry out or inspire large-scale attacks in the U S Despite their loss of physical territory in Iraq and Syria ISIS remains relentless in its campaign of violence against the United States and our partners  both here at home and overseas To this day ISIS continues to aggressively promote its hate-fueled rhetoric and attract like-minded violent extremists with a willingness to conduct attacks against the United States and our interests abroad ISIS successful use of social media and messaging apps to attract individuals seeking a sense of belonging is of continued concern to us Like oth</div></div> <div class="sidebar-flex section-content content region region-content has-sidebar-first has-sidebar-second"></div></div><footer class="w3-container w3-teal">
